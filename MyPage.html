          Hello my name is Juan. I am 2023 CSUDH graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have been programming since my senior year
          of high school and since then I have improved my skills. Some of the skills I have acquired include programming in several languages
          such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience dealing with Queries to create, get, update, or remove
          data from a database. Have experience using mySQL, Core Data, Android Studio, XCode and most recently Firebase and Spring Framework

          In the future I hope to become an App Developer, Software Developer, or a Web Developer because I find the process of creating a project 
          that does a task to be very interesting and entertaining. Everytime I work on a new project I feel like its a puzzle that I have to solve
          and I see it more as a game rather then actual work. I also enjoy creating projects that deal with retrieving, adding, updating, and 
          removing data.

          If you have read this far thank you for taking your time and reading all this. If you click on the Hamburger Button you can find a tab
          labeled "Projects" in which you will find all the different projects I have worked on. I will continue to update it with new projects I
          have created. If you don't know anything about object oriented programming I suggest starting with the tab labeled "Smaller Java Projects".

          Anyways thank you for your time and hopefully this was useful if you are starting to program.
          
          If you would like make sure to follow me on LinkedIn üëáüòÅ
