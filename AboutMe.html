  <h1>
    Hello my name is Juan. As of right now 8/9/2022 I am going into my senior year at CSU Dominguez Hills as a computer science major.
    My preferred programming language is java however I have programmed in javascript, python and a couple C languages. I have also
    done some coding that deals with data management and soon I will be adding some of my projects in my page. In the future I want to
    become a software engineer because I enjoy creating new things and hopefully this year I learn how to create apps. During my free
    time I enjoy watching anime, playing video games, and working on some programming projects. Also if you have seen all this I hope you
    can learn a little bit about programming through my projects ;)
